Title: E-commerce Platform During Sales Event
--------------------
Explanation:

        This simulation shows an e-commerce platform experiencing massive demand around day 18.
        The pattern indicates demand shock overwhelming capacity planning: transaction volume spikes 400%,
        cache hit ratio collapses causing thundering herd to backends, and infrastructure scaling hits limits.
        As systems struggle, payment gateway timeouts increase, session durations drop, and cart abandonment rises dramatically.
        This pattern is typical of Black Friday/Cyber Monday events without proper capacity planning.
