Title: Cloud Application Performance Degradation Indicators
--------------------
Explanation:

        This simulation shows a network bottleneck causing service degradation starting around day 18.
        The pattern indicates what appears as a database issue is actually a network problem between services.
        Note how CPU utilization remains reasonable while network throughput drops significantly.
        Connection pool exhaustion follows, causing database latency spikes and increasing error rates.
        This pattern is typical of microservice architecture issues where network partitioning occurs.
