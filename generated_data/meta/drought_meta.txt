Title: Severe Drought Impact Indicators
--------------------
Explanation:

        This simulation shows a worsening drought with critical ecological impacts around day 18.
        The combined patterns indicate a severe drought with cascading effects: depleted water resources,
        stressed vegetation, wildlife behavioral changes, and extreme fire danger.
        These patterns mirror real drought emergencies like those in California (2012-2016) and Australia (2017-2019).
