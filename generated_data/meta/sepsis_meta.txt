Title: Patient Sepsis Development Indicators
--------------------
Explanation:

        This simulation shows the development of sepsis in a patient, with critical deterioration around day 18.
        The pattern shows classic sepsis progression: initial infection with fever and elevated heart/respiratory rates,
        followed by shock with dropping blood pressure and potential organ failure.
        Early detection of these combined patterns can be life-saving.
