Title: Major Infrastructure Failure Indicators
--------------------
Explanation:

        This simulation shows a major infrastructure failure occurring on day 18.
        The pattern indicates a bridge collapse or similar critical failure: traffic flow
        suddenly stops, emergency vehicles converge, adjacent routes become congested,
        transit systems implement emergency protocols, and social media activity explodes.
        Weather remains normal, ruling out environmental causes.
