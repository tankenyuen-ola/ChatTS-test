Title: Crop Disease Outbreak Indicators
--------------------
Explanation:

        This simulation shows a fungal disease outbreak affecting crops, becoming critical around day 18.
        The combined data indicates ideal conditions for fungal pathogens: adequate moisture, 
        optimal temperatures, reduced sunlight, and increasing pest vectors, while normal nutrient levels
        rule out deficiency as a cause. Similar patterns occur in potato blight or wheat rust outbreaks.
