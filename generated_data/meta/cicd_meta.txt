Title: CI CD Pipeline Slowdown Indicators
--------------------
Explanation:

        This simulation shows a development pipeline slowdown becoming critical around day 18.
        The pattern indicates accumulating technical debt across the pipeline: test execution time
        growing exponentially, static analysis taking longer, build times increasing steadily,
        and deployment frequency dropping as a result. PR wait times increase dramatically,
        reducing developer productivity and creating a negative feedback loop.
        This pattern is common in maturing projects without dedicated optimization efforts.
