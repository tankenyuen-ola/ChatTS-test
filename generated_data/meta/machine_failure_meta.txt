Title: Production Line Critical Failure Indicators
--------------------
Explanation:

        This simulation shows a catastrophic machine failure occurring on day 18.
        The pattern reveals a preventable failure with multiple warning signs: increasing vibration,
        rising temperature, worsening quality issues, and overdue maintenance.
        The failure sequence includes energy spike, temperature surge, and complete production stoppage.
        Similar patterns occur before major industrial equipment failures across manufacturing sectors.
