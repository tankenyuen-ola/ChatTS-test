Title: Security Incident Detection Indicators
--------------------
Explanation:

        This simulation shows a sophisticated security breach starting around day 18.
        The pattern reveals an advanced persistent threat: initial access through password spraying,
        followed by privilege escalation, unusual after-hours activity, and data exfiltration through
        both direct outbound traffic and DNS tunneling. No single indicator is definitively malicious,
        but correlation across data sources reveals a clear attack pattern.
        This scenario demonstrates why security monitoring requires holistic analysis.
